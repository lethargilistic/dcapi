# Detective Conan API

Hello Detectives! This API will allow you to search raw data about Detective
Conan characters and cases. Why? Because nothing has existed like this before
and Detective Conan is an institution.

The data is stored in JSON files and accessible via a Weppy REST API that you can
self-host. Eventually, I'll set up a demonstration box, but this project is in
early stages.

Here is an example GET request for a character's Japanese name:

`GET [apiurl]/v0/character/1`
